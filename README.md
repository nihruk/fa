Create T3 App
This is a T3 Stack project bootstrapped with create-t3-app.

What's next? How do I make an app with this?
We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our Discord and ask for help.
